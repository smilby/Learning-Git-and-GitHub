# Pushing to GitHub

Pushing your local changes to GitHub ensures your code is saved and shared:

1. Make changes to your files locally.
2. Stage the changes:
git add .
3. Commit the changes:
git commit -m "Description of changes"
4. Push the changes to the remote repository:
git push origin main

Now your changes are on GitHub, visible to others.
